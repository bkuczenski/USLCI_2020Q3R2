This occurs under very precise conditions of temperature, pressure and tension. The result is a strong composite sheet of metal and plastic. Properly designed and installed, these metal composite panels provide a very reliable building envelope that resists the elements and protects against air and water infiltration.   Producing the panels requires a five-stage process. The metal coils are introduced from two pay-off reels (1). Next the laminating rollers bond the aluminum to the continuously extruded thermoplastic core (2). The laminated material then enters the cooling chamber and is constantly moved at a steady rate by the pulling rollers (3).  A protective masking film is then applied to the MCM to protect the surface finish (4). Finally, the MCM is trimmed to the required width, sheared to the required length, and stacked for inspection and final packaging (5).  The MCM sheet process includes all material and inbound transportation necessary for construction-ready products: coated aluminum coils, thermoplastic core, and packaging materials.  Energy and utility inputs include electricity, natural gas, process water, and propane.  All known solid waste, air, and water emissions are captured in the output.","version":"00.00.006","lastChange":"2019-09-08T21:51:16.023-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"283000ef-b319-3fff-a137-5116b70f8797","name":"3323: Architectural and Structural Metals Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","technologyDescription":"Composite building material of aluminum skin bonded to plastic core.
