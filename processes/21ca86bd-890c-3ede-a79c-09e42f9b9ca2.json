Complete inventory data and metadata are shown in full in the final report, Life Cycle Inventory of Polymer Composites.  The report is not publicly available. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates by Rebe Feraldi, Anne Marie Molen, and Melissa Huff and has undergone partial critical review by ACMA members. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
