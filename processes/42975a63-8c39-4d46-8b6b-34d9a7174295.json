The system boundary includes: 1) the transport of raw materials to multiple manufacturing facilities where various subcomponents are produced; 2) the manufacture of subcomponents; 3) the transport of subcomponents to a different manufacturing plant for final assembly; 4) the assembly of subcomponents into a complete scanner; and 5) the transport of generated waste from the manufacturing facilities to a municipal solid waste landfill.

Other inputs (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) were calculated on the basis of quantity of input per kg of scanner produced.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nUncertainty was estimated based on engineering judgment.  Material inputs had less uncertainty because they were based off of precise engineering specifications.  Other inputs  (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) had more uncertainty.
