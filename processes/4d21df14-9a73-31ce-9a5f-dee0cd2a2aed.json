According to IPAI 2002 statistics, the electricity profile for North American (Canada and the U.S.) smelters consists of the following fuels: hydro, 63.9%; coal, 34.6%; oil, 0.1%; natural gas, 0.4%; and nuclear, 0.9%. Of this electricity, 35.2% is self-generated and 64.8% is purchased.\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has \nundergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet \nundergone a formal validation process.\nPlease email comments to
