The transportation data was collected from an acetic acid producer and calculated using estimates. Includes material and energy requirements and environmental emissions for one kilogram of methanol by steam reformation of light hydrocarbons followed by low-pressure synthesis. The feed gas is compressed, preheated, and desulfurized. Then, it is mixed with steam and fed to the catalytic reformer. The synthesis gas from the reformer, containing primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, is cooled to remove condensate and reheated to the proper temperature for entry into the process-to-process interchanger. From the interchanger, the feed goes to a multi-bed inter-cooled methanol converter system. Converter effluent is sent to a cooler, and the crude methanol is removed from the gas mixture. Distillation is used to eliminate dissolved gases from the methanol before refining the crude product to obtain the desired grade. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding.","version":"00.00.022","lastChange":"2019-10-02T11:10:15.975-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"0927a450-e2b2-3455-983b-42ff1ebacc3c","name":"3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"Data from GREET 2017","technologyDescription":"","dataCollectionDescription":"Data was taken from GREET 2017","completenessDescription":"The inputs and emissions data for methanol are taken from GREET 2017 and the data for hazardous and non-hazardous waste material is taken from an industrial leader in methanol production.
