Upon exiting the reactor the formaldehyde is cooled and then sent to the absorber where it is absorbed into water to produce an aqueous solution.   Heat is recovered during this process, excess steam is captured and used elsewhere in the manufacturing process.   Various formaldehyde resins are then produced in a batch reactor by reacting formaldehyde with either urea, melamine, phenol, resorcinol or some combination of these.   The process involves heating the mix and controlling the reaction by controlling the temperature, pH, ratio of formaldehyde to urea, phenol, melamine, resorcinol or some combination of these chemicals, and the rate of charging until the desired degree of polymerization is achieved.   The reaction is quenched and then cooled.   If needed, water is stripped off to provide the desired percentage of resin solids.   Most of the process water is recycled and used within the production process.   Very little waste is generated by resin production.   Some production facilities used regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs), regenerative catalytic oxidizers (RCOs) and/or wet scrubbers as emission controllers to reduce the type and percentage of some emissions.   RTOs and RCOs require the additional use of electricity and natural gas for their operation.   It is noteworthy that essentially all production facilities started with methanol, only a very small amount (\u003c1%) of formaldehyde was purchased for these operations, as such it was not included in the analysis.","samplingDescription":"The survey represent 60% of total U.S. production for MUF resin; the production facilities were representative of U.S. production practices.
