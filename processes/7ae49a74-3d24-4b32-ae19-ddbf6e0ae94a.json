Associated natural gas is co-extracted with crude oil. The extraction of onshore associated gas is similar to the extraction methods for conventional onshore gas. The use of oil/gas separators is necessary to recover natural gas from the mixed product stream. The majority of these wells are assumed to be in Texas and Louisiana (US EIA, 2009a). The production rates of onshore associated gas wells are highly variable, but an average associated gas well in the U.S. produces 59 barrels of oil and 61 thousand cubic feet of natural gas per day (US EIA, 2009b).

Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"The input and output data for each of the subprocesses is taken from NETL unit process library and the most recent data is from 2010. The inputs to this unit process are natural gas, ground water, and surface water. These three inputs are natural resources and thus enter the boundary of this unit process with no upstream environmental burdens. If the natural gas extraction site is near a source of electricity, it is financially preferable to use electrically-powered equipment instead of gas-powered equipment. The output of this unit process is dehydrated natural gas that is suitable for pipeline transport and subsequent processing steps such as sweetening or, in the case of imported natural gas, liquefaction. This unit process also accounts for environmental emissions to air and water but does not track wastewater. ","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes (1) natural gas extraction (2) energy inputs for the process, and (3) water inputs for the process.\r\nDATA COLLECTION: A weighted average was calculated from the data collected for 6 extraction methods and used to develop the composite natural gas extraction process. \r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: All data were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.
