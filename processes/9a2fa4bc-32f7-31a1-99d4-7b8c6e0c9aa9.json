The amount of H2S in the sour natural gas varies widely depending on where it is extracted. Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
