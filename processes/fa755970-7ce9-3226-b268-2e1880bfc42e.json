Per the Vinyl Institute, there are no producers of chlorine using the mercury cell technology and selling to the EDC producers in the United States. This data module assigns 100% of chlorine production to diaphragm/membrane cell electrolysis. The collected datasets were weighted using these fractions.  Mass imbalance is due to unavailability of the weight of water inputs to production.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates by Rebe Feraldi and Melissa Huff and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and this module due to rounding. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
